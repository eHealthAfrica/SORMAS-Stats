# Dev helpers
1. `jupyter` contains a jupyter notebook docker to connect and interact with 
   the SORMAS DB for statistics. Useful for debugging and exploration.
2. `data-gen` contains python scripts to easily connect and push dummy entities. 
   Useful for debugging and showcases.
   
## Status Quo
This module needs to be cleaned up. Jupyter might be really useful, but `data-gen`
moved to its own [repo](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-data-generator).

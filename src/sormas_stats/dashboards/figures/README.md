# Figures

This folder contains code for all figures that are used in SORMAS-Stats.

## Implementation and Development

All figures extend the `Figure` abstract base class.

## plotly

We use [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) to create our figures.

Take a look at [plotly-express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) if you want to 
hit the ground running.
